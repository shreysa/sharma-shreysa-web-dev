This repository consists of the assignments done for the coursework CS5610 Web development under professor Jose Annunziato and a MEAN stack application project called Eat Hearty.

Eat hearty is a restaurant finding app that allows users to find a restuarant based on restaurant name or cuisine or location. Users can view restaurants by entering the required information. In order to check out reviews of the restaurant the user can make an account by either filling up a small information form or by using their Gmail or Facebook accounts. 

There is an Admin functionality as well that keeps checks on the reviews posted and can at anytime delete a review, grant admin rights to another user and revoke admin rights from a user.
